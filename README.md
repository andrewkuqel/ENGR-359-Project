# ENGR-359-Project

The Scope of this project is to use the arduino microcontrollers to assist individuals in their life.
This will be done by creating a low cost prosthetic hand with multiple sensors such as thermo, optic,
and touch to allow automated response. In addition the issue of accomplishing fine motor tasks will 
targeted by including an electromagnet for increased independence.
